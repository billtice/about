# Recent Activities - Bill Tice

<i>The items below represent recent (within the last 2 years) activities and contributions delivered in my professional role as a Cloud and Infrastructure Architect for IBM.</i>

## Cloud migration and transformation activities:

<ul>
<li>Transformed and automated the containerization, tagging and deployment of a monolith Java application, formerly hosted on an internal VM, to multi-zone IBM public Cloud kubernetes clusters with custom Calico global network policies, connected IBM gateway proxy services, and cloud observability LogDNA and SysDig layers.

<li>Launched SkyView - an interactive Cloud trends dashboard to be used for planning and prioritization which displays usage and resource data connected and driven through Cloudpak for Data (WatsonStudio) - Allows leadership to access 6 years worth of usage and billing data which is created through custom microservices and project assets.

<li>Successfully migrated Jazz/RTC applications deployed to on-prem VMs proxied to SoftLayer, to Github Enterprise, and IBM public Cloud Foundry.   Additionally developed and deployed ETL code to archive historical assets and change history.

<li>Refactored Cloud Foundry applications to microservices - determined performance and cost benefits to refactor targeted applications for transformation to microservices in IBM Cloud Functions.

<li>Created the StarChart - a graphical guide and complimentary documentation providing Leadership and Project teams paths to our currently available Cloud options, their special features and considerations, and costs.   This guide allows for us to get a clear perspective on our options, sizing and set the best path for transformation or migrations.

<li>Managed Watson Assistant service plan changes impacting processes, costs and automation by designing, communicating and creating custom microservices to align with the new changes while supporting the historical models.

<li>Onboarded transferred project application(nodeJS) and team from src to IBM public Cloud Foundry in less than one week.
</ul>

## Active Cloud native microservices (secure, serverless apis) in use:

<ul>
<li>ice-kube - containerized connection explorer utility designed to assist with  diagnostic and configuration needs related to <li>IBM Cloudâ€™s Kubernetes service and defining network policies
<li>figman - application configuration model and service for projects heading to cloud
<li>cubot - #slack integrated application connecting users to utilize Watson in Support assets
<li>access-automator - github/IBM Cloud repo and access-group sync solution
</ul>

## Active Infrastructure and CI/CD assets in use:

<ul>
<li>ci/cd templates which manage packaging, testinging and deploying src to Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and Functions environments
<li>vuman - on-prem virtual machine utilities required to support backend network and etl requirements 
<li>confairy - utility src to manage consistent and emergency rollout of Cloud Foundry UserProvidedServices(UPS) and Kuberenetes <li>Config-Maps and Secrets
</ul>

## Active cloud resource administration includes:

<ul>
<li>Devices, Clusters, Container Registry, Satellite, Cloud Foundry, Storage, Network, Functions(openwhisk), Apps, Pipelines, Code <li>Engine resources and hundred of service and software instances including:  Watson Studio/Cloudpak for Data, Cognos Embedded <li>Dashboard, Watson Discovery, Watson Assistant, Machine Learning, NLU, Cloudant, SecureGateway and more.
</ul>

<li>Internal IT/DevOps Accounts (on-prem)
</ul>

## Container experience:

<ul>
<li>Practical experience with Kuberentes, OpenShift, Container Registries, kubectl, calicoctl, Docker, and Podman.
<li>Provision, manage and automate clusters, workers, namespaces, config-maps, secrets, global network policies, jobs and more
<li>Designed and deployed custom pipeline components for organizational CI/CD efficiency
<li>Design, manage and maintain observability connections and dashboards, and notifications systems.
</ul>
